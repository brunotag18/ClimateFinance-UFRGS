# ABSTRACT

Climate change, a pressing global challenge, has wide-ranging implications for various aspects of our lives, including housing prices. This paper delves into the intricate relationship between climate change and housing prices in the United States. Using a comprehensive dataset and employing machine learning techniques, we analyze the relevance of climate variables for housing prices. Our findings suggest that climate change variables can influence housing prices, particularly in the short term, but the relationship is complex and varies by region. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for informed decision-making, sustainable urban development and climate risk mitigation.
