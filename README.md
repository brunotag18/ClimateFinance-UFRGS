# ABSTRACT

Climate change, a pressing global challenge, has wide-ranging implications for various aspects of our lives, including housing prices. This paper delves into the intricate relationship between climate change and housing prices in the United States. Using a comprehensive dataset and employing machine learning techniques, we analyze the relevance of climate variables for housing prices. Our findings suggest that climate change variables can influence housing prices, particularly in the short term, but the relationship is complex and varies by region. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for informed decision-making, sustainable urban development and climate risk mitigation.

# EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

In brief, the study analyzes data spanning several decades, incorporating climate-related variables such as anomalies in temperature, precipitation, and drought. To model housing returns, the paper utilizes stepwise boosting, an iterative algorithm that gradually integrates variables to balance model complexity and mitigate the risk of overfitting.

In assessing how climate change variables contribute to predictive performance, multiple models were tested, incorporating macroeconomic factors, financial factors, non-economic factors, non-financial factors, and measures of uncertainties. Finally, the study also examines the relevance of climate-related variables in housing return modeling, particularly by analyzing their selection rates within the boosting algorithm

# METHODOLOGY

At the core of the stepwise boosting methodology lies the following logic. It seeks to construct a parsimonious yet highly effective linear model within the challenge of high-dimensional data. To circumvent the inconsistency, stepwise boosting constructs this model in an incremental fashion, systematically incorporating variables one by one. This iterative approach endeavors to arrive at the optimal model, one that encapsulates best the relationships between variables. The outcome is a function that aptly balances predictive accuracy and model simplicity. In this section, we delve into the intricacies of this stepwise boosting methodology and elucidate its application within the context of our research, culminating in a robust framework for predictive analysis
